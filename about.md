<p>Hey, my name is Mustapha Yusuf, a Student of Computer Science who sees himself a Junior Developer, my love in Technology led me to be a Programmer and my love in Design led me to be a Front End Developer. What i know is, all these Practices go with Rules and Principles, that is why i love Engineering, what i always want to know is what drives them to their exixtence.</p>

<p>Having Large Experience in Windows since i was Young makes me go into Windows Development, from VB.Net to learning C# which offers me to be in diiferent Fields in Microsoft Technologies like WinForms, Wpf, Asp.Net, Xamarin (MAUI in recent Months) and use Azure Cloud as my Back-End Service. Visiting differnt Websites makes me be in love of Website Design which led me to be a Front-End Developer using Fancy Animations, Transitions and Colourful Elements</p>

<p>I always want to practice some Experiences, that is why i delve into User Experience Design having Google as a good Source to my Study and also my Mentor, being a UX Engineer makes you think defferent (which i really want) and also makes you speak to your Audience without giving a single Word, and sometimes it is much better than to Speak.</p>

<p>I also want to talk about the Engineering behind our Technologies, why is it Important, because it is the Back-End of all what we do in codes, because it leads to make a Projects to be Standard, think of MVC, MVVM, MVP, DI, IoC and other Enginnering Patterns which makes us be good Programmers, it is the Enginners who suggest how to have a good Practice and also how to manage our Objects, that is why i always say there is a deep Comparisons between Software Programmers and Software Engineers as my Respect always go to the Software Engineers!</p>
