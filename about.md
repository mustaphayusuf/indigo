<p>Hey, my name is Mustapha Yusuf, a Student of Computer Science who sees himself a Junior Developer, my love in Technology led me to be a Programmer and my love in Design led me to be a Front End Developer. What i know is, all these Practices go with Rules and Principles, that is why i love Engineering, what i always want to know is what drives them to their exixtence.</p>

<p>I always want to practice some Experiences, that is why i delve into User Experience Design having Google as a good Source to my Study and also my Mentor, being a UX Engineer makes you think defferent (which i really want) and also makes you speak to your Audience without giving a single Word, and sometimes it is much better than to Speak.</p>

<p>I always want to talk about the Engineering behind our Technologies, why is it Important, because it is the Back-End of all what we do in codes, because it leads to make a Projects to be Standard, think of MVC, MVVM, MVP, DI, IoC and other Enginnering Patterns which makes us be good Programmers, it is the Enginners who suggest how to have a good Practice and also how to manage your Objects, that is why i always say there is a deep Comparisons between Software Programmers and Software Enginners as my Respect always go to the Enginners!</p>
